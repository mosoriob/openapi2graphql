  # Property to indicate dimensionality of the input or output of a dataset specification
  hasDimensionality: [Int!]

  # Format followed by a file. For example, txt, nc, etc.
  hasFormat: [String!]

  # Property that indicates the relative path of an input or output with respect to the folder structure of the executable.   For example, let&#39;s assume we have an input that has to exist in the folder &#x60;/datasets&#x60; or the executable will not work. This property ensures that this knowledge is captured for a given software component execution.  In this case the property would capture this as follows:  &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; :input_prep a sd:DatasetSpecification . :input_prep rdfs:label \&quot;precipitation file\&quot; . :input_precip sd:pathLocation \&quot;/datasets/\&quot;. &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  pathLocation: [String!]

  # Relates a dataset specification to the data structure definition
  hasFileStructure: [TodoObjectMapping]

  # small description
  description: [String!]

  # Property that associates an input/output with their corresponding data transformation.
  hasDataTransformation: [DataTransformation]

  # Property that links an instance of a dataset (or a dataset specification) to the presentation of a variable contained (or expected to be contained) on it.
  hasPresentation: [VariablePresentation]

  # short description of the resource
  label: [String!]

  # type of the resource
  type: [String!]

  # Property that links a parameter or an input to a fixed value. For example, in a given configuration a parameter with the planting date for a model could be fixed to avoid the user changing it for that region.
  hasFixedResource: [SampleResource]

  # Property to identify the original source of the information of the annotated resource. It could be a web page, an organization, a person, some experiment notes, etc.
  hadPrimarySource: [TodoObjectMapping]

  # Property to link an input/output dataset to the specific data transformation (with URLs
  hasDataTransformationSetup: [DataTransformationSetup]

  # Position of the parameter or input/output in the model configuration. This property is needed to know how to organize the I/O of the component on execution
  position: [Int!]

  # identifier
  id: String!

  # Value associated to the described entity
  value: [TodoObjectMapping]
